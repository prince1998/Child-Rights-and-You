At CRY, we are committed to our vision for a happy, healthy and creative childhood for every child. Over the course of the next 10 years, and to continue to make children and their rights a priority, we have reiterated goals that CRY as an organisation is committed to strive for. These include ensuring children in CRY-supported projects have access to free and quality education, primary healthcare and are safe from violence, abuse and exploitation. We will also work towards reducing the rate of child malnutrition and make sure children’s voices are recognised in issues that affect them.

The ‘RIGHT’ Way of Working
‘Charity’ alone is not a lasting solution to enable change for the millions of children living in India today, who have little or no access to food or education and are exploited daily. A rights-based approach ensures that entitlements are available to all children without any discrimination. They are universal and non–negotiable. Along with our project partners, CRY ensures that the government fulflls their duty by providing the necessary infrastructure and services as per the needs of the people and at the best quality possible. We believe that the best interest of the child needs to be put at the centre of all policy, legislation and practices affecting their lives.
